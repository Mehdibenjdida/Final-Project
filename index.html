    <h1>We Tuft ,Your Story</h1>
  </div>
  <div >
    <p>
        One of the reasons why tufting has become so popular is the creativity and flexibility
         with the design.
        
         Actually, it is a process to create floor rugs. 
         But it allows you to explore creativity and transform it into different forms. 
         You don't have to stick to the general rules with it. 

   
        Framing it can be one of the best ways to use a tufted rug.
        
         You can easily place a tufted rug into a frame and hang it on 
         the wall as an excellent decoration for your space. 
         After the rug is done, you can simply place it on the frame and use it. But of course, 
        it is possible to create your custom frame for a specific rug as well.

   <h1>Essential tufting supplies
  </h1>
<h2>
  1. A Tufting Machine
</h2>
<div>
<img src="TuftingGun_.webp" alt="">
</div>
   
   <p>
    The most essential tool for tufting is the tufting gun itself,
     a portable sewing machine that shoots and cuts yarn into a canvas.

The AK-1N Pink and Loop Pile is the most popular tufting gun in the world. 
It has all the features you need to make professional quality carpets and rugs. 
We recommend the AK-1N for both first time users and experienced tufters.

It’s lightweight, has all the features needed, and it’s considered 
by many to be the best tufting gun in the world. The AK-1N is easy
 to set up and hard to break, both of which are extremely common problems with tufting. 
 It weighs just 1.4kg, making it’s great for longer tufting sessions.

Proper maintenance will keep your tufting gun going for years, 
read more on maintenance here. The only item that needs replacement after extended
 use is the scissors, as these will become less sharp over time.
   </p>
   <h2>2. Yarn that matches your needs</h2>
   <div>
   <img src="yarnballs-edited.jpeg.webp" alt="">
  </div>
   <p>
    There are three populair types of yarn: Cotton, Wool and Acrylic. 
    The type to use depends on what kind When making a rug, 
    it’s important to use the right type of yarn. Three types are popular: cotton, wool, 
    and acrylic. Cotton yarn is often used in 
    floor rugs because it can handle wear and tear. Wool is stronger than cotton, 
    but it also costs more. Acrylic yarn is cheap and easy to find, but it doesn’t hold its 
    shape as well as cotton or wool does when stepped on.

The thickness of the yarn does not matter as long as you can fit it in your tufting gun.
 We recommend a 3 or 4 ply, and to use two strands of yarn in your tufting gun at the same time.
  This gives the best results, and delivers a thick line in your backing cloth. 
  Using just one thin string can give issues like cloth tearing.
   </p>
   <h2>3. A wooden frame with frame grips</h2>
   <div>

  </div>
   <h2>4. Rug Backing and Final Backing cloths</h2>
   <div>
   <img src="backing-cloth-on-frame-grips-edited.jpeg.webp" alt="">
  </div>
   <p>
    Primary tufting cloth is your blank canvas, the cloth where you will shoot your yarn into. Because of the high speeds and aggressive nature of tufting machines, you need a very specific kind of rug backing. We offer cloths especially made for tufting guns, it stretches easily and comes with the right size of holes. It also comes with yellow lines every 5 centimeters to help you guide. If you want to practice and not waste any rug backing, you can try some burlap.

When placing the rug backing on your frame, make sure it is very tight. It should be so tight that a coin will bounce off. You need to keep a constant pressure on the rug backing when tufting. A side effect is that the rug backing will lose its tightness. It is best to re-stretch the rug backing on your frame after a long session. Make sure the yellow lines are still straight and not curvy after re-stretching, so your rug design is not altered.

Final (secondary) backing is the cloth that you place on the backside and acts as a clean and protective finish. If you do not use a final backing, you would have your latex touching the floor and it just doesn’t look good, especially if you plan on selling rugs.
   </p>
   <h2>5. Carpet Glue (Latex)</h2>
   <p>
    After you are completely done tufting, you need to glue the back of the rug backing. Typically any carpet adhesive or carpet glue will work. Glue your rug before you cut the rug out, as the yarn is still loose in the cloth. Letting the glue dry while the rug is still hanging in the frame will also keep your rug from curling up as it dries.

The general rule is anything that has an adhesive will work. This can include latex paint, matte medium, Elmer’s glue, PVA glue, carpet adhesive, or mask latex. If you’re looking for a more flexible version you need to find a glue with mostly latex.

Keep in mind that carpet glue stinks, and sometimes the fumes are toxic. Let your rug dry in a place well ventilated.
